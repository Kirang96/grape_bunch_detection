                                            GRAPE BUNCH detection project
                                        ---------------------------------------

PLAN:

PROBLEM:
Create a model that can identify grape bunches

SOLUTION:
Few shot learning method that uses a Resnet pretrained model as backbone. Modify the last layer of the Resnet model to a single class and train that layer with a small dataset of grape bunch images downloaded from the internet.
